        <p> Hi! I am Halle Cooper from Idaho.
            As a sixth grade teacher in Burley, Idaho, I absolutely adore all things math, and I pour that passion into my teaching. 
            Alongside equations and fractions, I also share my love for dance, choreographing routines that range from solos to group performances in jazz, lyrical, hip hop, and ballet. 
            With three solos under my belt this year, I've been busy!
            I've been married to Bryton Cooper for four wonderful years this August. 
            When I'm not in the classroom or choreographing, you can find me soaking up the sun by the pool, buried in a good book.
            I'm the oldest of nine siblings, and my upbringing earned me the nickname "Gumby" for my extreme flexibility.
            And you better believe that flexibility adds some flair to my dance routines! With my love for all things hot, I often wish summer could last all year long. 
            That warmth and energy I soak up during the summer? I bring it right back into the classroom, making learning just as exciting as a sunny day by the pool.
            Thank you for visiting my page, I am doing my best to learn and grow in every way I can. I hope I can show that through this process.</p>

        <p>Idaho, known as the Gem State, is a rugged and beautiful expanse of the American West. Its landscape is defined by vast stretches of wilderness, including mountains, forests, and pristine lakes. Home to iconic landmarks such as the Sawtooth Mountains and the Snake River, Idaho offers outdoor enthusiasts ample opportunities for adventure, from hiking and skiing to whitewater rafting. Beyond its natural wonders, Idaho boasts a rich cultural heritage, with a blend of Native American, European, and pioneer influences evident in its small towns and vibrant cities like Boise, the state capital. With a strong agricultural tradition, particularly in potato farming, Idaho's economy thrives alongside its stunning scenery, making it a truly unique and captivating destination.</p>
