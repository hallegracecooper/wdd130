        <p>Idaho, known as the Gem State, is a rugged and beautiful expanse of the American West. Its landscape is defined by vast stretches of wilderness, including mountains, forests, and pristine lakes. Home to iconic landmarks such as the Sawtooth Mountains and the Snake River, Idaho offers outdoor enthusiasts ample opportunities for adventure, from hiking and skiing to whitewater rafting. Beyond its natural wonders, Idaho boasts a rich cultural heritage, with a blend of Native American, European, and pioneer influences evident in its small towns and vibrant cities like Boise, the state capital. With a strong agricultural tradition, particularly in potato farming, Idaho's economy thrives alongside its stunning scenery, making it a truly unique and captivating destination.</p>
