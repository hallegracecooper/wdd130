                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2010 by a group of avid adventurers and environmental enthusiasts, our company began as a small operation with a deep passion for the rivers and the stories they hold. 
                    Our founders, who first met as rafting guides in their college years, were driven by a shared vision to offer more than just a thrilling ride; they wanted to create a gateway to nature that educates, inspires, and respects the environment. 
                    Over the years, we have grown into a premier rafting service known for our commitment to safety, community, and sustainability. 
                    From our humble beginnings with just a few rafts and a single riverside cabin, we now host thousands of thrill-seekers each year, helping them discover the majesty of the rapids while preserving the natural beauty of our beloved rivers. 
                    Our story is one of passion, adventure, and an unwavering commitment to making every rafting experience unforgettable.
